									<p>LEAD Trust is an NGO formed on 24th October 2009 by a group of highly qualified professionals and academicians of Bengaluru city. It aims to promote excellence in the fields of education and leadership among Indian youth. To achieve this, it aims to set up coaching and guidance centres, conduct seminars, workshops, education fairs, inter-school programmes to improve overall excellence of students and to propagate human values, ethics, morality and virtuous character. The aim is to identify students who are brilliant, but due to inadequate awareness of good educational opportunities coupled with their poor economical condition are unable to get into prestigious academic institutes and pursue their dream careers.</p>
									<p>LEAD has been inspired by the success of the ‘Super 30’ initiative in Bihar, which in-turn has motivated the Rahmani foundation in Bihar to form a ‘Rahmani 30’ group specifically helping downtrodden students to get admissions into IITs. Both these initiatives have succeeded in identification and support of bright poor students. As its first initiative, LEAD focussed on the Engineering exams (IIT-JEE and AIEEE) in Karnataka and Kerala. Since then, LEAD has expanded into Maharashtra and Tamilnadu. Moreover, in 2012, it has started selecting bright students for Medicine (NEET), Law (CLAT, LSAT) and Pure Sciences (Indian Institute of Sciences, Chennai Mathematical Institute, Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research and National Institute of Science Education and Research).</p>
									<p>LEAD Trust is run completely by volunteers who dedicate their time and effort, without any remunerations. We are a 100% non-profit organization with 80G (tax exemption) clearance from the Government of India., We strive to improve the educational condition of the deserving students. Race, ethnicity, caste, religion, etc are no bars. Our organization aims to help all the bright and educationally/economically backward students from India.</p>
